    <h1>My Mission</h1>
    <p1 class="About_Info">
        I created this PWA to document the recipes I have used to gain weight and build muscle. When I started going to the gym, I genuinely struggled to find cheap, calorie-dense meals that were easy to prepare. It was tough to know what to eat to fuel my workouts without breaking the bank. This app is a way to keep track of the meals that worked for me, making it easier for others to follow a similar path without the hassle of searching for ideas</p1>
