                <li>1 Large Chicken Breast</li>

                <li>1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shredded cheese (White)</li>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>When I was bulking, I found that Chicken and Rice Bowls were a lifesaver. They’re a perfect balance of protein, carbs, and healthy fats, which are all essential for muscle growth. The chicken provides lean protein to help build and repair muscle, while the rice gives me the energy I need to power through my workouts.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you like (garlic powder, paprika, cumin, etc.)</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat</li>
                <li>Cook the chicken breast for 5-7 minutes per side until it’s cooked through and golden brown. Let it rest for a couple of minutes before slicing it into strips.</li>
                <li>While the chicken is cooking, prepare your rice if it’s not already cooked. You can use white or brown rice, whichever you prefer. A rice cooker or stovetop works great—just follow package instructions.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, layer the cooked rice as the base</li>
                <li>Top with the sliced chicken breast</li>
                <li>Add sliced avocado and shredded cheddar cheese for extra calories, if desired</li>
                <li>Mix everything together or keep it layered. Serve immediately and enjoy your simple, high-protein, high-calorie chicken and rice bowl!</li>
                <li>Voila!</li>
            </ol>
